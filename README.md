# Multiverse
Next generation data storage back-end for the widely used Alembic file format.

> Authors: Aghiles Kheffache, Marco Pantaleoni, Bo Zhou, Paolo Berto Durante.

## Repository organization

The original upstream Alembic code resides in the [master](https://github.com/j-cube/multiverse/tree/master) branch.

The `Multiverse` code for the `2.0.0` release, resides in its own [2.0.0/multiverse](https://github.com/j-cube/multiverse/tree/2.0.0/multiverse) branch and is the default landing branch for the repository when browsing on GitHub.

To use `Multiverse`, just checkout its branch:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/j-cube/multiverse.git
...

$ git checkout 2.0.0/multiverse
```

Note that both `Multiverse` code for `1.5.8` and `2.0.0` releases match Alembic API 1.5.8 and these branch could be merged and even fast-forwarded on the upstream `1.5.8` tag.

Support for Alembic API v1.6+ will be added after SIGGRAPH 2016.

## Multiverse dependencies

In addition to the original Alembic dependencies, `Multiverse` needs the following additional dependencies:

* [libgit2 v0.23.4+](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/archive/v0.23.4.tar.gz)
* [msgpack 1.0.1+](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-c/releases/download/cpp-1.0.1/msgpack-1.0.1.tar.gz)
* [boost 1.48.0+](http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.48.0/boost_1_48_0.tar.bz2/download) compiled also with `chrono`, `filesystem`, `system` (in addition to the original `program_options`, `thread` and `python`)
